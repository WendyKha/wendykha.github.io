### Favorite Lab from CPSC 120
* Lab 01
  
  This is my first using C++ for an assignment. Learning to use a terminal and knowing the command was quite challenging but I understood by the end. Lab one was my favorite lab.

* Lab 02
  
  The second was another favorite of mine because it was easy. The only problem that me and my partner had was the whitespace. However, we found where the issue was and fixed it.

* Lab 05, part 1
  
  This part of the lab was simple. It is easy math and an easy program to write. Although me and my partner had issues we were able to solve them.
